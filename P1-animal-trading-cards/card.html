			<p class="fact">Polar bears aren't white at all, but are transparent. Under intense microscopic imaging their hairs are hollow tubes, without color. This allows them to act like miniature fiber-optic tubes, trapping the warmth of the ultraviolet rays and funneling them back into the bear's body.</p>

			<p>Polar bears are marine mammals, and spend much of their time on Arctic sea ice. Many adaptations make polar bears uniquely suited to life in icy habitats. Their fur is thicker than any other bearsâ€™ and covers even their feet for warmth and traction on ice. A thick layer of blubber beneath their fur provides buoyancy and insulation. The long neck and narrow skull of the polar bear probably aid in streamlining the animal in the water while warming the air that they breathe, and their front feet are large, flat and oar-like, making them excellent swimmers.</p>
