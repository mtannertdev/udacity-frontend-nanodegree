#### Commentary from the author
This project was more of a test of my actual programming skills, and I focused on that more than making the UI beautiful or flashy. I could have added more than five points of interest. I could have taken great pains to make the layout more attractive. I did not, but I have done enough UI work previous projects to be confident in my skills. In this project, I met my goals of understanding the interplay of the frameworks and APIs, and I am content with that.
